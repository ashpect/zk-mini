# zk-mini
Implementation of a minimal ZK system. <br>

## Features

- [X] Basic ZK system : /v0 branch
- [X] Make the system succint - QAP : /v1 branch
- [ ] Make it trustless
- [ ] Support for public witnesses
- [ ] Test for multiple general set of R1CS constraints
- [ ] Generate constraints from a program 

The order of our prime field needs to equal the order of the elliptic curve. - why ?
