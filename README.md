# zk-mini
Implementation of a minimal ZK system. <br>

## Features

- [X] Basic ZK system : /v0 branch
- [X] Make the system succint - QAP : /v1 branch
- [X] Test with multiple mock R1CS constraints
- [X] Make the system trustless - Trusted Setup
- [ ] Verification of the trusted setup
- [ ] Support for public witnesses
- [ ] Test for multiple general set of R1CS constraints
- [ ] Generate constraints from a program 


v2 (trusted setup (only tau), prover can still fake) : https://www.rareskills.io/post/elliptic-curve-qap.
v3 (groth 16 without public outputs) :
