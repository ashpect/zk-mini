# zk-mini
Implementation of a minimal ZK system.
V1 : Very basic zk system which is not succint, for learning purposes.

## Features/TODO

- [X] Basic ZK system : /v0 branch
- [X] Make the system succint - QAP : /v1 branch
- [ ] Make it trustless
- [ ] Make z public
- [ ] Generalize for any set of constraints
- [ ] Generate constraints from a program

The order of our prime field needs to equal the order of the elliptic curve. - why ?
